<b>Process:</b><br>

- Used AssetStudio to first extract the SharedAssets.assets textures;<br>
- AI Enhanced 1x, Enhanced 2x and 4x with Upscayled, <br>
- Created RAW folder for textures<br>
- Used a custom Batch file to convert PNG textures to 4 different settings:<br>
  Low: Upscaled - 1X Textures<br>
  Medium: Upscaled - 2X Textures<br>
  High: Upscaled - 4X Textures<br>
- Rebuilt the asset file.

<b>Dependencies:</b><br>
- None

<b>Installation instructions:</b><br>

(Please note that you need the base game, as the packages do not include everything)<br>

- <a href="https://github.com/Lucke001/KSP-Upscaled-Core/releases">Download the settings you want in the release section;</a><br>
  Low: 1k Textures maximum<br>
  Medium: 2k Textures maximum<br>
  High: 8k Textures maximum<br>
- Extract to the <b>MAIN KSP FOLDER</b>, overwriting the files;<br>
- add this command to the launch parameters of KSP: -force-d3d11<br>
- Optionnal: Create a SWAP file to compensate for low RAM<br>
- Play<br><br>



<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>

Be careful of your RAM usage with this package, as it is demanding on hardware. You will notice that your RAM compresses the files during the process, liberating some precious space to run the game

I recommend testing with: <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/ShowFPS">Show FPS</a> & <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/MemGraph">MemGraph</a>. You will have a good idea of the performance hit you get with the textures.

Have fun !
