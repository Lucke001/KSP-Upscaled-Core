<b>Process:</b><br>

- Used AssetStudio to first extract the Shared.assets.9 file;<br>
- Extracted only textures, constituted of 2 folders. Sprite and Texture2D<br>
- AI Enhanced 4x with HitPaw Photo Enhancer<br>
- Created RAW folder for textures<br>
- Used XNView MP to compress the PNG textures to 4 different settings:<br>
  Low: 2048x2048 Textures<br>
  Medium: 4196x4196 Textures<br>
  High: 8192x8192 Textures<br>
  Extreme: 16384x16384 Textures<br><br>

<b>Dependencies:</b><br>
- Texture Replacer
- Module Manager<br><br>

<b>Installation instructions:</b><br>

(Please note that you need the base game, as the packages do not include any of the configs or models, it is only textures)<br>

- <a href="https://github.com/Lucke001/KSP-Upscaled-Core/releases">Download the settings you want in the release section;</a><br>
  Low: 2k Textures maximum<br>
  Medium: 4k Textures maximum<br>
  High: 8k Textures maximum<br>
  Extreme: 16k Textures maximum<br>
- Extract to the GameData folder, overwriting if necessary;
- add this command to the launch parameters of KSP: -force-d3d11
- Optionnal: Create a SWAP file to compensate for low RAM
- Play<br><br>



<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>

Be careful of your RAM usage with this package, as it is VERY demanding on hardware. You will notice that your RAM compresses the files during the process, liberating some precious space to run the game

I recommend testing with: <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/ShowFPS">Show FPS</a> & <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/MemGraph">MemGraph</a>. You will have a good idea of the performance hit you get with the textures.

Have fun !
